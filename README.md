	<summary><b>API Issue found</b></summary>

The backend queries received didn't work properly. So I am using all the data from the request: `https://tools.texoit.com/backend-java/movies?size=206`.
	
These are the routes that doesn't return the expected data:
	
```
	  https://tools.texoit.com/backend-java/movies?page=9&size=99&winner=true&year=2018
	  https://tools.texoit.com/backend-java/movies?projection=years-with-multiple-winners
	  https://tools.texoit.com/backend-java/movies?projection=studios-with-win-count
	  https://tools.texoit.com/backend-java/movies?projection=max-min-win-interval-for-producers
	  https://tools.texoit.com/backend-java/movies?winner=true&year=2018
```
	
Those routes reponse are almost equals and doesn't represent the contract mentioned in the challenge pdf.
